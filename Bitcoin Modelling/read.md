This project uses a linear regression algorithm to determine if the volume of trades links to the high price of a trade on that day.
As the high price is an absolute value, it was converted to relative value by measuring the percentage difference between the high price and the average price daily.
The R squared value was around 0.45 so a fairly weak correlation.
